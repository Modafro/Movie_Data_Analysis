# Movie Data Analysis
This project will analyse various metrics for thousands of movies

## Getting Started
Download the project folder on your local machine. There will be 4 files in the project folder (excluding the README file):
- Project_Movie_Data_Analysis.html
- Project_Movie_Data_Analysis.ipynb
- Project_Movie_Data_Analysis.py
- tmdb-movies.csv

### Prerequisites
At webbrowser (preferably Chrome, Firefox or Safari) is sufficient to view the data analysis. However, to view the source code in its original environment you will need to have a notebook document which contains both computer code (python in this case) and rich text elements. I suggest using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

### View Data Analysis
#### 1. View in Webbrowsser
 - You can simply use the .html file to view the data analysis 
#### 2. View in Jupyter
 - Go to [Jupyter] (https://jupyter.org/try)
 - Select "Try Jupyter with python"
 - Once the default repo has been loaded, on the top left corner, select "File" -> "Open..."
 - A new window will open (binder/), on the top right corner, select "upload" and upload the Project_Movie_Data_Analysis.**ipynb** & tmdb-movies.**csv** files
 - Once uploaded, click on the Project_Movie_Data_Analysis.ipynb, you will now be able to view and run the analysis in the Jupyter environment
 
## Built With

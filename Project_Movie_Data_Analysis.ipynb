    "The following work serves to analyse the data of more than 10,000 movies. The first part of this project will focus on data wrangling to clean up the data and subsequently perform an analysis with the cleaned up data. The second analysis will focus on studying different trends and correlations so that tentative conclusions can be made. Assumptions will clearly be stated and by no means are the conclusions of this work definitive but more so speculative as no rigorous statistical analysis will be performed. The project will present tentative relations between different sets of data and the reader is encouraged to use their own critical approach to these conclusions\n",

    "The correlation in this case is weak but it is there, the level of popularity for movies tend to increase over time. I would speculate, beyond the scope of available analysis that other reasons may be that tmdb.com istself did not become a prevalent go to for movie amateurs until recently. So maybe people started voting on tmdb when they joined tmdb which would have been in 2008 when tmdb was created. Aslo the demographic most likely to join tmdb are on the younger side of things and maybe wouldn't want to necessarily watch a movie from the 60s? Take myself for example, I've been a member of imdb (not tmdb...) for 12 years now and have over 1000 votes for various tv shows and movies, most of them starting from the 80s. I don't really watch movies that are before the 80s simply because I don't want to! So maybe many millenials and generation Zs might feel the same way?\n",

    "This project attempted to analysis on a limited capacity the movie data of ~4,000 movies. There were definitely some intersting trends but as mentioned throughout the project, many assumptions were made and no statistical analysis was made so the findings will remain tentative. However, readers will get a feel of some relationships that exits between different parameters such as the more popular a movie is, the more votes there will be for the rating of a given movie or that spending the big box on budget doesn't necessarily translate into better ratings!\n",

    "There have been some limitations to this project. The adjusted budget and revenue to account for inflation is one of them. We don't know what inflation rate was used to arrive at those adjusted values. Was it an average based on inflation over the last 10 years? 20 years? 30 years? We don't know. Also we do not officially know how popularity was measured. As we've seen, over the years, the level of popularity increased but why is that? Are people watching more movies now than they did 40 years ago? Or is it the other way around? How exactly was popularity measured in 1960? 1970? Or any movies that date before 2008, the year tmdb was created. \n",
